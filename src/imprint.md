## Decentralized Protocol

JuiceSwap is a decentralized protocol deployed on the Citrea blockchain. It operates autonomously through smart contracts without central management or control.

## No Central Operator

Unlike traditional services, JuiceSwap:

- Has **no company** behind it
- Has **no employees** or management
- Has **no physical address** or headquarters
- Is **not operated** by any single entity

The protocol is:

- Governed by JUICE token holders through veto-based governance
- Maintained by an open-source community of contributors
- Operated entirely by immutable smart contracts

## Open Source

All JuiceSwap code is open source and available at:

- **Smart Contracts**: [github.com/JuiceSwapxyz/smart-contracts](https://github.com/JuiceSwapxyz/smart-contracts)
- **Documentation**: [github.com/JuiceSwapxyz/documentation](https://github.com/JuiceSwapxyz/documentation)
