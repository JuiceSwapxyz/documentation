# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 2025**

## Overview

JuiceSwap is a decentralized protocol that prioritizes user privacy. This policy explains how data is handled when you interact with JuiceSwap.

## Blockchain Transparency

JuiceSwap operates on a public blockchain (Citrea). By design:

- All transactions are publicly visible on the blockchain
- Wallet addresses and transaction history are permanently recorded
- This data cannot be deleted or modified

**This is a feature, not a bug.** Transparency ensures trustless operation without intermediaries.

## What We Don't Collect

The JuiceSwap smart contracts:

- Do not collect personal information
- Do not require registration or accounts
- Do not store data off-chain
- Do not track user behavior

## Frontend Interface

If you use a web interface to interact with JuiceSwap:

### Minimal Data

- We do not use tracking cookies
- We do not collect analytics
- We do not require sign-ups

### Technical Data

Standard web server logs may include:

- IP addresses (not linked to wallet addresses)
- Browser type and version
- Access timestamps

This data is used solely for security and debugging purposes.

## Third-Party Services

When using JuiceSwap, you may interact with:

| Service | Data Shared |
|---------|-------------|
| **Wallet providers** (MetaMask, etc.) | Transaction data |
| **RPC providers** | Blockchain queries |
| **Block explorers** | Transaction lookups |

These services have their own privacy policies.

## Your Rights

Since JuiceSwap is decentralized:

- **No data to delete** - We don't store your personal data
- **No accounts to close** - There are no accounts
- **Full control** - You control your wallet and keys

## Self-Custody Principles

JuiceSwap embodies cypherpunk privacy principles:

- **Your keys, your coins** - Only you control your assets
- **Pseudonymity** - Interact using wallet addresses, not identities
- **Permissionless** - No KYC or identity verification required
